  Converter
-------------

Overview
--------
Converter is a class defined in src/CqSim/Converter.py
It provides a standard API to a number of layout converters.

API Calls
---------
coords = convert_from_idx(type, **kwargs):
idx    = convert_to_idx(type, **kwargs):

where type   is the layout to be converted to/from
      idx    is the index of the original node
      coords is the coordinates of the node in the specified layout
  and kwargs is the dictionary of arguments to be provided to the converter

In other words, Converter methods take a type of layout specified by a string
and a dictionary of arguments to the converter. It then passes the arguments
to the relevant converter and relays the result to the caller. More details
concerning layout converter implementation can be found in its section.

Additional layout converters can be added by changing the Converter.py file:
1) Import the relevant converter class.
2) Add the converter to the self.converters dictionary initialization.


---------------------
  Layout Converters
---------------------

Overview
--------
Layout converters allow for the converting to and from node indices.

Details
-------
A layout converter is expect to implement the following methods:
convert_from_idx(**kwargs)
convert_to_idx(**kwargs)

In order to ensure this implementation, it is highly recommended to extend
converters from Layout_Base. Additionally, for the sake of consistency, it is
recommended that the calls follow these standards:

convert_from_idx should obtain its index argument using the key 'index' and
                 should return the resulting coodinates as a list'

convert_to_idx should obtain its coordinate arguments using the key 'coords'
